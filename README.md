## Description  
_The “What” Space_ is a research project that investigates the emotional variability and expressive potential of spoken language. Focusing on the word **“what,”** the project examines how shifts in emotional prosody shape its interpretation.

Drawing from the **IEMOCAP** database, we identified **54 instances** of “what,” each annotated with **categorical emotion labels** and **continuous values** in the **valence–arousal–dominance (VAD)** space.

To explore these variations, we developed a series of multimodal visualizations, including:

- 🎮 An **interactive 3D visualization** in Unity3D   [HERE](https://jfforero.github.io/TheWhatSpace/) 
- 🌐 **Network-based structures** in Blender  
- 🖥️ A **real-time speech-to-texture web application**    [HERE] (https://huggingface.co/spaces/jfforero/LoopArtCritique)
- 🕶️ An **immersive virtual reality installation** hosted on [Onland.io](https://www.onland.io)

These experiences allow users to **navigate a spatialized soundscape** of “what” utterances and **directly experience their emotional diversity**.

This work contributes to:

- **Affective computing**  
- **Speech emotion recognition**  
- **Human–computer interaction**

By revealing the **rich affective range embedded in a single word**, _The “What” Space_ underscores the importance of **prosody in communication** and demonstrates the potential of **speech-based affective virtual environments**.
